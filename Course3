Dynamic Programming
Understanding the prolem and implementing a solution which is space and time efficient by structuring it into sub problems.


Name: Vennesh
Module name: Divide and Conquer

Divide and conquer algorithms are most widely used in sorting techniques like merge sort.
we will divide the problem into various sub problems and find solutions to sub problems then will combinely get the main problem solution
